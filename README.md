This is my second project for 5340 where we created a Converter app for currency and crypto. 
On the left side in the blue boxes just like in the module you will have the currecy converter, and on the tab at the top you can switch over to the crypto converter where it will show you 
different crypto and their price
Both cards you can flip. The final product is below:
